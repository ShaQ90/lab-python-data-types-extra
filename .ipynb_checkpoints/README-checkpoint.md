## Introduction

In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to dive into one of the fundamental building blocks of programming: data types.

As you may already know, data types are the different kinds of values that can be stored in a program, such as integers, floats, and strings. 

Understanding data types is essential to working with data in any programming language.
